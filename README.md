# SmartMirror / MagicMirror

### This guide will explain how anyone can build a Smart Mirror with only a bit of effort . This guide will give you all the steps and all the modules that I have used in my Smart Mirror . 

##### OK, so starting with some basics , the magic mirror will consist of the MagicMirror^2 operating system that runs on a Raspberry pi 3b+ and monitor behind a two way mirror encased in a wooden enclosure. I have installed the following cool modules in my magic mirror -clock , news feed , current weather , weather forecast , Holidays , YouTube , Spotify , Google Assistant . 

###### PS: You can modify the modules on the basis of your own interest . I will also attach the list of all the modules available with the magic mirror operating system which you can follow to build your own personalised magic mirror . 

##### It took me approx. 3 weeks to finish with this project .
