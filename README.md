# SmartMirror / MagicMirror

### This guide will explain how anyone can build a Smart Mirror with only a bit of effort . This guide will give you all the steps and all the modules that I have used in my Smart Mirror . 

##### OK, so starting with some basics , the magic mirror will consist of the MagicMirror^2 operating system that runs on a Raspberry pi 3b+ and monitor behind a two way mirror encased in a wooden enclosure. I have installed the following cool modules in my magic mirror -clock , news feed , current weather , weather forecast , Holidays , YouTube , Spotify , Google Assistant . 

###### PS: You can modify the modules on the basis of your own interest . I will also attach the list of all the modules available with the magic mirror operating system which you can follow to build your own personalised magic mirror . 

##### It took me approx. 3 weeks to finish with this project . 

## EQUIPMENT - 
##### 1) Raspberry Pi Model 3B + (Model 3B would also work) *1 [https://www.amazon.in/iONiQ-Raspberry-Pi-LPDDR2-Bluetooth/dp/B07CWVSMLS/ref=sr_1_6?crid=1R7WUGYYO1U05&keywords=raspberry+pi+3b%2B&qid=1563791459&s=gateway&sprefix=raspberry+pi+3%2Caps%2C450&sr=8-6]
##### 2) MicroSD Card *1 (atlest 8 GB)
##### 3) Raspberry Pi Power Cable *1 
##### 4) Monitor *1
##### 5) HDMI Cable *1
##### 6) Mouse and Keyboard *1
##### 7) USB Mic (For Google Assistant) [https://www.amazon.in/LipiWorld%C2%AE-Portable-Studio-Speech-Mic/dp/B07MR9KM4X/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?keywords=usb+mic&qid=1563791417&s=gateway&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1]

## STEP 1 :
### SETTING UP RASPBERRY PI :
#### First you will need to install the latest version of Raspbian, the officical Raspberrypi operating system. When I installed the magic mirror the latest OS was Raspbian Buster. The OS can be found on the official site of the Raspberry pi (https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) . You  need to flash the image file on SD card . You can use ETCHER for flashing purpose (https://www.balena.io/etcher/)

## STEP 2:
### BOOT UP YOUR PI
#### Unmount the SD card from your computer and insert it into your Pi. Connect your keyboard, mouse, HDMI cable and lastly the PI's power cable. Now you would be able to see the Raspbian Pixel Desktop on your television .(or other screen that you may have used ).

#### Once the pi starts up and you have configured it , run the following commands in the terminal - 
##### ```sudo apt-get update ```
##### ```sudo apt-get upgrade ```

##### Now once the raspberry pi is updated we can install the magicmirror. First, open a browser and go to the following URL “https://magicmirror.builders”. Scroll down to the section labeled “Easy to install” and copy the following bash command: 

##### ```bash -c "$(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MichMich/MagicMirror/master/installers/raspberry.sh) ```

##### Next, open a terminal and paste the above code. Press enter to execute the command.  
 
##### When the installation is finished execute the following command in the terminal to start the “MagicMirror2” software:  
 
 ##### ```  cd ~/MagicMirror ```
#####    ```npm start  ```
  
##### This will run your Magic Mirror with some pre installed modules.You can edit the preinstalled modules by settig the news feed of your location , weather of your area etc. by modifying the config.js file in MagicMirror directory. Now if you want to customize your magic mirror you have to install / clone some modules and then add some channgesto config.js folder in MagicMirror directory in home/pi . 

## SPOTIFY MODULE 

Open a new terminal and execute the following commands: 
```  curl -sL https://dtcooper.github.io/raspotify/install.sh | sh  ```

The module “Raspotify” allows connection to “Spotify”. It comes pre-configured and will be discoverable on the local network as a “Spotify Connect” device. However, it can be configured by editing the “/etc/default/raspotify” file which passes arguments to the “librespot” function. 

``` # /etc/default/raspotify -- Arguments/configuration for librespot 
 
# Device name on Spotify Connect #DEVICE_NAME="raspotify" 
 
# Bitrate, one of 96 (low quality), 160 (default quality), or 320 (high quality) #BITRATE="160" 
 
# Additional command line arguments for librespot can be set below.
# See `librespot -h` for more info. Make sure whatever arguments you specify 
# aren't already covered by other variables in this file. (See the daemon's 
# config at `/lib/systemd/system/raspotify.service` for more technical details.) 
# 
# To make your device visible on Spotify Connect across the Internet add your 
# username and password which can be set via "Set device password", on your 
# account settings, use `--username` and `--password`. 
# 
# To choose a different output device (ie a USB audio dongle or HDMI audio out), 
# use `--device` with something like `--device hw:0,1`. Your mileage may vary. 
# 
#OPTIONS="--username <USERNAME> --password <PASSWORD>" 
 
# Uncomment to use a cache for downloaded audio files. Cache is disabled by 
# default. It's best to leave this as-is if you want to use it, since 
# permissions are properly set on the directory `/var/cache/raspotify'. 
#CACHE_ARGS="--cache /var/cache/raspotify" 
 
# By default, the volume normalization is enabled, add alternative volume 
# arguments here if you'd like, but these should be fine. 
#VOLUME_ARGS="--enable-volume-normalisation --linear-volume --initial-volume=100" 
# /etc/default/raspotify -- Arguments/configuration for librespot ```
 
The user’s “Spotify” account can be added by uncommenting the line shown below and replacing the “<USERNAME>” and “<PASSWORD>” sections with the user’s “Spotify” account credentials. 

``` #OPTIONS="--username <USERNAME> --password <PASSWORD>"  ```
```
#### “Last.fm” Scrobbler Installation and Configuration 
The “Last.fm Scrobbler” will display track information such as the album cover art, song name, and artists for the currently playing song on the “Raspotify” module. 
 Open a new terminal and execute the following commands: 
 
 ``` cd  ~/MagicMirror/modules ```
 ```git clone https://github.com/PtrBld/MMM-Scrobbler.git  ```

Open a web browser and go to the URL “https://www.last.fm/join” and register for a “Last.fm” “API account”. 
Copy the generated API key and place it into an empty text file for future use. 
 
A23 
 
Add the following code to the “config.js” file which is located in the “~/MagicMirror/config” directory and change the “username” and “apikey” sections to the username and API key that was created in the previous steps: 
 
 ```
 {     
 module: 'MMM-Scrobbler',
 position: 'top_right', 
 config: { 
 
username: 'Last.fm username', 
apikey: 'Last.fm api key', 
//time interval to search for new song (every 15 seconds)    
updateInterval: 15 * 1000,    
//how often should we try to retrieve a song if not listening    
delayCount: 5,    
//time interval to search for new song if the 5 times not listening is received.    
//set this to the same number as updateInterval to ignore this option  
 
  delayInterval: 120*1000,   
  animationSpeed: 1000,   
  showAlbumArt: true,       
  showMetaData: true, 
 
  //Determines the position of the meta text. Possible values: top, bottom, left, right    alignment: "bottom",         }   
  } 
  ```
